# NK04_Maskless_Photolithography
Project repository for developing an LCOS based maskless photolithography process.

---
## Objective
To develope an optical setup which is able to:
- Achieve <= 1um feature size
- Ability to expose photoresists at wavelength (405nm / 465nm)
- (Optional) Step the substrate for wafer stepping
- (Optional) Make use of the phase-shift ability of LCOS for phase shift masking
